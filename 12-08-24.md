- [Problem Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months&role=full-stack)
- Solution
```python
# constraints: 0 <= digits.length <= 4,  we only need to worry about 2-9 inclusive, so we do not have to worry about uppercase, input can be 0. 
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        # digits is empty
        if digits=="":
            return []
        phone={'2':'abc', '3':'def','4':'ghi','5':'jkl','6':'mno','7':'pqrs','8':'tuv','9':'wxyz'}
        s = 0
        # find first valid start character between 2-9
        while not(ord(digits[s])>=ord("2") and ord(digits[s])<=ord("9")):
            s+=1
        _start=phone[digits[s]]
        ret=[[_start[i]] for i in range(len(_start))]
        for i in range(s+1,len(digits)):
            # make sure digit is between 2-9
            if ord(digits[i])>=ord("2") and ord(digits[i])<=ord("9"):
                phone_digits = phone[digits[i]]
                newsets = []
                for j in range(len(phone_digits)):
                    for arr in ret:
                        newArr = arr.copy()
                        newArr.append(phone_digits[j])
                        newsets.append(newArr)
                ret = newsets
        
        return ["".join(arr) for arr in ret]
# Time Complexity: O(4^N * N) 4^N is the largest of the possibilities for the combination. N is the length of digits.
# Space Complexity: O(4^N) we generate this many subsets. This is inevitable. We use the intermediate subsets to generate more subsets.
```
- Time complexity can be improved, Space Complexity can not.
- Had bugs on type mismatches between integer in hash key and character in digits string. I put newsets inside the phone digits for loop. newsets should be outside phone digits for loop because we are generating new sets for each phone_digit iteration. Then we append those new sets for each phone digit.
- Time Complexity: We need to run through that again! There are 3 for loops nested inside of each other and a .copy() function.
- This is why I need to ask about the length of the inputs for constraints: 
    - One of the first things you should always do is look at the constraints. Quite often, you can figure out what sort of approach needs to be taken simply from looking at the input size. In an interview, asking your interviewer about the constraints will also show your attention to detail - on top of giving you information. In this particular problem, the length of the input is extremely small, 0 <= digits.length <= 4. With such small input sizes, we can safely assume that a brute force solution in which we generate all combinations of letters will be accepted.

- Back Tracking Solution
```python
def letterCombine(digits):
    if(len(digits)==0):
    phone={'2':'abc', '3':'def','4':'ghi','5':'jkl','6':'mno','7':'pqrs','8':'tuv','9':'wxyz'}

    ret = []
    def backtrack(index, combination):
        if index==len(digits):
            ret.append(''.join(combination))
            return # backtrack
        
        letters = phone[digits[index]]
        for letter in letters:
            combination.append(letter)
            backtrack(index+1, combination)
            combination.pop() # backtrack
    
    backtrack(0,[])
    return ret
    # Time Complexity: O(4^n * n). The worst case woul dbe all 7s and 9s which have 4 characters.
    # Space Complexity: O(N) the recursion call stack will go as deep as the number of digits in the input. Then when we reach that depth we backtrack
```

- [Problem Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/) HARDDDD!
- Solution Simple O(m+n) Time Complexity. Move the pointer to get the merge of both arrays.
- The solution below is clever and does the pointer movements all the way to the middle of the "merged" array
```python
   def findMedianSortedArrays(
        self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]
    ) -> float:
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        p1, p2 = 0, 0

        # Get the smaller value between nums1[p1] and nums2[p2].
        def get_min():
            nonlocal p1, p2
            if p1 < m and p2 < n:
                if nums1[p1] < nums2[p2]:
                    ans = nums1[p1]
                    p1 += 1
                else:
                    ans = nums2[p2]
                    p2 += 1
            elif p2 == n:
                ans = nums1[p1]
                p1 += 1
            else:
                ans = nums2[p2]
                p2 += 1
            return ans

        if (m + n) % 2 == 0:
            for _ in range((m + n) // 2 - 1):
                _ = get_min()
            return (get_min() + get_min()) / 2
        else:

                _ = get_min()
            return get_min()
```
- Solution log(min(n1,n2)) solution! Difficult to understand
```python

- Problem Above-Average Subarrays
```
Above-Average Subarrays
You are given an array A containing N integers. Your task is to find all subarrays whose average sum is greater than the average sum of the remaining array elements. You must return the start and end index of each subarray in sorted order.
A subarray that starts at position L1 and ends at position R1 comes before a subarray that starts at L2 and ends at R2 if L1 < L2, or if L1 = L2 and R1 â‰¤ R2.
Note that we'll define the average sum of an empty array to be 0, and we'll define the indicies of the array (for the purpose of output) to be 1 through N. A subarray that contains a single element will have L1 = R1.
```
- Extra complicated solution that does not work using back tracking
- The problem with this solution is that we are not generating all possible subarrays we are finding contiguous subarrays.
```python
def aboveAverageSubarrays(A):
  # edge cases
  if len(A)==0:
    return []
  if len(A)==1:
    return A
  
  totalAvg = sum(A)/len(A) # Time Complexity O(n)
  output = []
  def findSubarray(subarray, subtotal, index):
    if index==len(A):
      subavg = subtotal/len(subarray)
      if subavg > totalAvg:
          firstIndex = subarray[0]+1
          lastIndex = subarray[-1]+1
          output.append([firstIndex, lastIndex])
      return # backtrack
    
    for i in range(index, A):
      subarray.append(i)
      subtotal+=A[i]
      findSubarray(subarray, subtotal, index+1)
      popI = subarray.pop()
      subtotal-=A[popI]
  
  findSubarray([],0,0)
  output = sorted(output, key=lambda arr: arr[0],arr[-1]) # sort by the last and first of the arr
  return output
```
- Actually working solution
- Cool things:
    - A subarray could be just 1 element
    - subarray_size can be calculated by doing `j-i+1`.
    - We can sort array of arrays by doing .sort in python!
```python
def aboveAverageSubarrays(A):
    n = len(A)
    total_sum = sum(A)
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over all possible subarrays
    for i in range(n):
        subarray_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Compute the sum of the current subarray
            subarray_sum += A[j]
            subarray_size = j - i + 1
            # Compute the average of the subarray
            subarray_avg = subarray_sum / subarray_size
            
            # Remaining elements calculation
            remaining_size = n - subarray_size
            remaining_sum = total_sum - subarray_sum
            if remaining_size > 0:
                remaining_avg = remaining_sum / remaining_size
            else:
                remaining_avg = 0
            
            # Check if the subarray average is greater
            if subarray_avg > remaining_avg:
                result.append([i + 1, j + 1])  # Convert to 1-based indexing
    
    # Sort the results
    result.sort()
    return result

# Example usage
A = [3, 4, 2]
output = aboveAverageSubarrays(A)
print(output)

- [Problem Insert Into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months)
- Solution
```python
    def insert(self, head: 'Optional[Node]', insertVal: int) -> 'Node':
        if head==None:
            # create a singular node and make it point to itself
            newNode = Node(insertVal)
            newNode.next = newNode
            return newNode
        curr = head

        while True:
            if curr.val<=insertVal<=curr.next.val:
                break
            
            # reached the last element
            if curr.val>curr.next.val:
                if curr.val<=insertVal>curr.next.val:
                    # insertVal is the greatest element
                    break
                
                if curr.next.val>=insertVal<curr.val:
                    # insertVal is the smallest element
                    break
            curr = curr.next

            # all elements are equal
            if curr == head:
                # reached the end
                break
        
        newNode = Node(insertVal)
        tmp = curr.next
        curr.next=newNode
        newNode.next = tmp
        return head
```
- the edge cases to test here are all the elements are equal, the target is the greatest element, the target is the smallest element, and the target is equal to the greatest element and the target is equal to the smallest element.
- The head won't always point to the smallest element but we know if we hit the head that all the elements in the array are equal.
- when we create a single node we have to make sure we point it back at itself.

- Solution
```python
    # two pointer approach
    def findRLEArray(self, encoded1: List[List[int]], encoded2: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        e1 = 0
        e2 = 0
        l_e1 = len(encoded1)
        l_e2 = len(encoded2)
        product_enc = []
        while e1<l_e1 and e2<l_e2:
            # print('encoded1[e1][0]',encoded1[e1][0])
            # print(' encoded2[e2][0]', encoded2[e2][0])
            min_freq = min(encoded1[e1][1], encoded2[e2][1])
            product = encoded1[e1][0] * encoded2[e2][0]
            # print('product',product)
            if not product_enc or product != product_enc[-1][0]:
                # new product or empty product_enc
                product_enc.append([product, min_freq])
                encoded1[e1][1]-=min_freq
                encoded2[e2][1]-=min_freq
            else:
                # same product
                product_enc[-1][1] += min_freq
                encoded1[e1][1]-=min_freq
                encoded2[e2][1]-=min_freq
            # e1 or e2 frequencies the same so we move the pointers
            if encoded1[e1][1]==0:
                e1 += 1
            if encoded2[e2][1]==0:
                e2 += 1

        return product_enc
        # O(e1+e2) space and time complexity
```
- Messed up with adding the frequency to the wrong place in the else statement and I did not subtract the min_freqs from the encoded array. (Also must make sure with interviewer that modifying the original data structure is okay)

- Solution
```python
        # keep the last seen index. Because abs(i-j)<=k. so distance between i and j is less or equal to k.
            # the last index will bring us the closest to less than or equal to. We do not need to store indices before that
        # O(n) space complexity

- [Problem Friends of Appropriate Ages](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months) TODO Come back to this problem
- Solution
```python
    # 1. age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
    # 2. age[y] > age[x]
    # 3. age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100

    # first condition establishes a minimum age for y 
    # second condition states y cannot be older than x
    # third condition states that if y is older than 100 then x has to be older than 100 too. Redundant so remove

    
    def numFriendRequests(self, ages: List[int]) -> int:
        # optimal approach is to use binary search but we have to sort ages first
        # cannot figure out binary search condition
        agesCount = Counter(ages) # dict of value: their counts
        agesKeys = sorted(agesCount.keys(), key=lambda x:-x) # sort keys in decreasing order so x > y
        requests = 0

        # find mutual friends
        for x in agesKeys:
            if agesCount[x]>1 and x>14:
                # 14 fails the 1st condition
                # we can form pairs of friends with everyone except with oneself
                requests += agesCount[x]*(agesCount[x]-1)

        for i in range(len(agesKeys)):
            x = agesKeys[i]
            for j in range(i+1, len(agesKeys)):
                y = agesKeys[j]
                if x*0.5+7 < y and x > y:
                    requests += agesCount[x]*agesCount[y]
        return requests
        # time complexity: O(n^2) to look at x and mutual xs
        # space Complexity: O(n) to store agesCount
```
- I could not find the binary search solution for this. But I got it!
- I switched the places of x and y in my logic so I got confused on the implementation of the first condition
- the age 14 limit comes from the first condition. It was only required for the mutual friends logic.

        # List to store (row, col, value)

        # Convert to list in the correct order
        return [output[col] for col in sorted(output.keys())]
```
- O(nlogn) Time Complexity from sorting
- O(n) Space Complexity with all the data structures we are using
- DO NOT MAKE INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS. I made the assumption that same row, col will be right next to each other which is wrong! I had no basis to make this assumption other than the patterns I saw in the input immediately and I thought it would continue. The solution I had previously was also more complex. Above is a good solution!
      - .sort() will sort lexicographically meaning it will break ties by comparing to the next value in the tuple. So that works out perfectly. We sort by col first, then row, so now we have earlier cols first and its associated earlies rows first, and finally comparing it by value if the rows and cols are equal.

            # a node can only appear in the path sequence once. So left->root->right to then root-> parent is not a path!
            # Return only left path or right path. 
            # and below logic works for a leaf node as well to return the leaf node value
            return max(sumLeft+node.val, sumRight+node.val)

- [problem Valid Number]()
- Solution
```python
    def isNumber(self, s: str) -> bool: 
        # regex = r'^[-+]?\d*((\d+\.?)|(\.\d+))(\d+e[-+]?\d+)?$'

            if s[i].isdigit():
                seenDigit=True
            elif s[i]=='E' or s[i]=='e':
                if seenDigit==False or seenExponent==True:
                    # no exponent without digits before

                #     return False
                seenExponent=True
                seenDigit=False # we need digits after exponent
            elif s[i]=='+' or s[i]=='-':
                if i > 0 and s[i-1]!='E' and s[i-1]!='e':

                    # if i>0 and its not preceeded by an exponent return False
                    return False
            elif s[i]=='.':
                # decimal
                if seenDecimal==True or seenExponent==True:
                    # could only see decimal once
                    # cannot see decimal after exponent
                    return False 
                seenDecimal=True
            else:
                return False # invalid character
        return seenDigit
```
- Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity:O(1)
- Having if statements is enough if we simplify it down to have we seenDigit. This works elegantly for decimals, exponents, +-. Because we have to see a digit before or after these. From there we can figure out the groups and its rules to implement before implementing.

- [Problem Continuous Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum/)
- The suboptimal approach is to generate all subsets and verify if the subarraySum is a multiple of k by doing subArraySum%k. And that is O(n^2) time complexity and O(1) space Complexity. I am not storing prefix sums or any other auxillary storage
- The optimal approach for this problem uses prefix sums. At first I thought it could be sliding window but could not easily find contract and expand conditions for sliding window
```python
# Optimal Approach involves Prefix Sum and Hashing

# Intuition: if the mod for the prefix sum exists in the array 
# (prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i]) % k == 0
# this can be simplified to prefixSum[j]%k = prefixSum[i]%k
# remember in the sum we are not including the value of i

    def checkSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        if len(nums)<2:
            return False
        if len(nums)==2:
            return (nums[0]+nums[1])%k==0
        subArraySum = 0
        prefixSum = {0:-1} # init like this to handle cases where subarray starts from beginning
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            subArraySum += nums[i]
            mod = subArraySum%k
            if mod in prefixSum:
                if i-prefixSum[mod]>1:
                    # because index at prefixSum[mod] is not included in the subarray
                    return True
            else:
                # update the dict with the index encountered first so we can find the largest possible subarray
                prefixSum[subArraySum%k] = i
        return False
        # Optimal Approach
        # O(n) Time Complexity
        # O(1) Space Complexity
```

- [Problem Accounts Merge]()
- Solution
```python
# create an adjacent list graph to connect all emails in each account
    # this graph contains the edges that merges the email lists
# run dfs on each user and their emails. We need to store a visited to prevent visiting an email twice!
def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
        account_hash = {}
        output = []
        # we are creating an adjacent list to the user's first email and the other emails in the account.
        # we are also linking the other emails in the account to the user's first email
        # we have an edge going to every email now with the first user email acting as the center
        for account in accounts:
            firstEmail = account[1]
            if firstEmail not in account_hash:
                account_hash[firstEmail] = set()
            if len(account)>2:
                for email in account[2:]:
                    account_hash[firstEmail].add(email)
                    if email not in account_hash:
                        account_hash[email]=set()
                    account_hash[email].add(firstEmail)
        visited=set()
        def dfs(email, emailOutput=[]):
            if email not in visited:
                visited.add(email)
                emailOutput.append(email)
                for neighbor in account_hash[email]:
                    dfs(neighbor, emailOutput)
            return

        for account in accounts:
            emailList = []
            dfs(account[1],emailList)
            if emailList:
                emailList.sort()
                accountOutput = [account[0]]
                accountOutput.extend(emailList)
                output.append(accountOutput)
        return output
# Time Complexity: O(MlogM) for each account its going through each of its emails. M being the total unique number of emails. The first loop is O(M). DFS is O(M+E) E being the edges visited which could be M so its O(M). Then the sorting step summing up all of the sorting going on it will still be dominated by O(MlogM).
# Space Complexity: O(M) we will store M unique emails in the data structure. The recursion stack visiting edges will be O(M) in the worst case.
```
- Below code is problematic.
    - Default Mutable arguments are defined once when the funciton is defined and not each time the function is called. This means that emailOutput is reused across all calls to the dfs funciton!
```python
    def dfs(email, emailOutput=[]):
        if email not in visited:
            visited.add(email)
            emailOutput.append(email)
            for neighbor in account_hash[email]:
                dfs(neighbor, emailOutput)
        return emailOutput

    for account in accounts:
        emailList = dfs(account[1])
        print('visited',visited)
        print('emailList',emailList)
        if emailList:
            emailList.sort()
            accountOutput = [account[0]]
            accountOutput.extend(emailList)
            output.append(accountOutput)
    return output
```

- [Problem is Graph Bipartite]
- Graph is bipartite if you can color the adjacent nodes alternate colors:
- Solution
```python
def isBipartite(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        colors = [0]*len(graph) # 0 means not colored

        def dfs(node, color):
            colors[node] = color
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if colors[neighbor]==0:
                    # call dfs to color the neighbor and give neighbor the opposite color
                    if not dfs(neighbor, -color):
                        return False
                if colors[neighbor]==color:
                    # neighbor has the same color as the node
                    return False
            return True # adjacent nodes have alternating colors
        
        # the graphs can be disconnected
        for node in range(len(graph)):
            if colors[node]==0:
                if not dfs(node, 1):
                    return False

        return True
```
- returning inside a for loop will terminate the loop early we only want to do that when returning a False.
- Time Complexity: O(N+e), N being the number of nodes and e the number of edges. We visit each edge once and then it will not call that edge no more.
      - You do not process an edge twice because of the colors data structure check. So its O(n+e) and not O(n*e)
- Space Complexity: O(n) n is the maximum the stack of recursively called functions can go and also the maximum of colors.

- [Problem Valid Sudoku]()

```python
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # hash set of rows, columns, and grid
        rows = [set() for _ in range(len(board))]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(len(board))]
        grid=[[set() for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

        nRows = 9
        nCols = 9
        for r in range(nRows):
            for c in range(nCols):
                gridR = r//3
                gridC = c//3
                if board[r][c] == '.':
                    continue
                if board[r][c] in rows[r]:
                    return False
                if board[r][c] in cols[c]:
                    return False
                if board[r][c] in grid[gridR][gridC]:
                    return False
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                grid[gridR][gridC].add(board[r][c])

        return True
```
- I had a naming conflict with rows. Make sure to validate every line of code at the end.

- [Problem Iteratively Reverse Linked List]()
- Iterative Solution
```python
def reverseLinkedList(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    if head==None:
        return None
    
    # iteratively 
    prevNode, currNode = None, head
    while currNode:
        nextNode = currNode.next
        currNode.next = prevNode
        prevNode = currNode
        currNode = nextNode
    return prevNode
```
- Recursive Solution
```python
    def recurseList(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or head.next==None:
            # find head of reverseList, this will bubble up through recursive call
            return head
        
        new_head = recurseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = head # we verified or made it so .next.next is None
        head.next=None # next recurse back track is the previous node in the forward iteration
        # prevNode -> head -> next=None
        return new_head
```

- [Problem Remove Nth Node from End of Linked List]()
- Solution
```python
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        trailerNode=currNode = head
        i = 1
        while i != n:
            currNode = currNode.next
            i+=1

        if currNode.next==None:
            # the head is the nth node to remove
            new_head = head.next
            head.next=None
            trailerNode.next=None
            return new_head

        prevNode = None
        while currNode.next != None:
            prevNode = trailerNode
            trailerNode = trailerNode.next
            currNode = currNode.next
        
        prevNode.next = trailerNode.next
        return head
# Time Complexity: O(n) we visit each node once
# Space Complexity: O(1) we do not use any extra space proportional to the input.
```
- Pay attention what the nth node looks like from the end. 1 is the actual last node.
- So starting from the same node is the i=1. trailerNode should end up at the last node if i=1.
- We have the case if currNode.next==None then the head is the nth node to remove that was a clever finding by me.
- More code efficient solution
```python
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(-1, head)
        trailerNode=currNode=dummy
        for _ in range(n):
            currNode = currNode.next
            if not currNode:
                return None

        while currNode.next != None:
            trailerNode = trailerNode.next
            currNode = currNode.next
        
        # trailerNode.next is the node to delete
        trailerNode.next = trailerNode.next.next if trailerNode.next else None
        # dummy.next will return the head even when head is None
        return dummy.next
```
- created a dummy node to return the dummy.next which will point to head or None.
- trailerNode is one behind the nth last element. so when we do trailerNode.next = trailerNode.next.next we are breaking the .next connection to the nth node.

- [Problem Linked List Intersection]()
- Intuition for the two pointer solution:
```python
# [1,2,3,4,5], [3,3,4,5]
# [1,2,3,4,5][3,3,4,5]
# [3,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5]
```
- See how the tails of the intersecting nodes line up!
- Solution that does not work:
```python
def intersectLinkedList(self, head1: Optional[ListNode], head2:Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # edge case
    if head1==None or head2==None:
        return None
    ptr1,ptr2 = head1,head2

    while ptr1!=ptr2:
        ptr1 = ptr1.next if ptr1.next else head2
        ptr2 = ptr2.next if ptr2.next else head1
    return ptr2
```
- the check if ptr1.next is not working. It will not return a node if there is no match. I was stuck trying to figure out how to do that. I should run through a small example and that could give me hints!!!
- Solution that does work:
- Intuition: We should have the loop exit when we reach the end of the merged list.
```python
# [1,2,3][1] 
# [1][1,2,3]
# p1=1, p2=1 -> p1=2, p2=1 -> p1=3, p2=2 -> p1=1, p2=3 -> p1=None, p2=None
```
```python
def intersectLinkedList(self, head1: Optional[ListNode], head2:Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    # edge case
    if head1==None or head2==None:
        return None
    ptr1,ptr2 = head1,head2

    while ptr1!=ptr2:
        ptr1 = ptr1.next if ptr1 else head2
        ptr2 = ptr2.next if ptr2 else head1
    return ptr2
```
