- [Problem Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months&role=full-stack)
- Solution
```python
# constraints: 0 <= digits.length <= 4,  we only need to worry about 2-9 inclusive, so we do not have to worry about uppercase, input can be 0. 
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        # digits is empty
        if digits=="":
            return []
        phone={'2':'abc', '3':'def','4':'ghi','5':'jkl','6':'mno','7':'pqrs','8':'tuv','9':'wxyz'}
        s = 0
        # find first valid start character between 2-9
        while not(ord(digits[s])>=ord("2") and ord(digits[s])<=ord("9")):
            s+=1
        _start=phone[digits[s]]
        ret=[[_start[i]] for i in range(len(_start))]
        for i in range(s+1,len(digits)):
            # make sure digit is between 2-9
            if ord(digits[i])>=ord("2") and ord(digits[i])<=ord("9"):
                phone_digits = phone[digits[i]]
                newsets = []
                for j in range(len(phone_digits)):
                    for arr in ret:
                        newArr = arr.copy()
                        newArr.append(phone_digits[j])
                        newsets.append(newArr)
                ret = newsets
        
        return ["".join(arr) for arr in ret]
# Time Complexity: O(4^N * N) 4^N is the largest of the possibilities for the combination. N is the length of digits.
# Space Complexity: O(4^N) we generate this many subsets. This is inevitable. We use the intermediate subsets to generate more subsets.
```
- Time complexity can be improved, Space Complexity can not.
- Had bugs on type mismatches between integer in hash key and character in digits string. I put newsets inside the phone digits for loop. newsets should be outside phone digits for loop because we are generating new sets for each phone_digit iteration. Then we append those new sets for each phone digit.
- Time Complexity: We need to run through that again! There are 3 for loops nested inside of each other and a .copy() function.
- This is why I need to ask about the length of the inputs for constraints: 
    - One of the first things you should always do is look at the constraints. Quite often, you can figure out what sort of approach needs to be taken simply from looking at the input size. In an interview, asking your interviewer about the constraints will also show your attention to detail - on top of giving you information. In this particular problem, the length of the input is extremely small, 0 <= digits.length <= 4. With such small input sizes, we can safely assume that a brute force solution in which we generate all combinations of letters will be accepted.

- Back Tracking Solution
```python
def letterCombine(digits):
    if(len(digits)==0):
    phone={'2':'abc', '3':'def','4':'ghi','5':'jkl','6':'mno','7':'pqrs','8':'tuv','9':'wxyz'}

    ret = []
    def backtrack(index, combination):
        if index==len(digits):
            ret.append(''.join(combination))
            return # backtrack
        
        letters = phone[digits[index]]
        for letter in letters:
            combination.append(letter)
            backtrack(index+1, combination)
            combination.pop() # backtrack
    
    backtrack(0,[])
    return ret
    # Time Complexity: O(4^n * n). The worst case woul dbe all 7s and 9s which have 4 characters.
    # Space Complexity: O(N) the recursion call stack will go as deep as the number of digits in the input. Then when we reach that depth we backtrack
```

- [Problem Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/) HARDDDD!
- Solution Simple O(m+n) Time Complexity. Move the pointer to get the merge of both arrays.
- The solution below is clever and does the pointer movements all the way to the middle of the "merged" array
```python
   def findMedianSortedArrays(
        self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]
    ) -> float:
        m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
        p1, p2 = 0, 0

        # Get the smaller value between nums1[p1] and nums2[p2].
        def get_min():
            nonlocal p1, p2
            if p1 < m and p2 < n:
                if nums1[p1] < nums2[p2]:
                    ans = nums1[p1]
                    p1 += 1
                else:
                    ans = nums2[p2]
                    p2 += 1
            elif p2 == n:
                ans = nums1[p1]
                p1 += 1
            else:
                ans = nums2[p2]
                p2 += 1
            return ans

        if (m + n) % 2 == 0:
            for _ in range((m + n) // 2 - 1):
                _ = get_min()
            return (get_min() + get_min()) / 2
        else:
            for _ in range((m + n) // 2):
                _ = get_min()
            return get_min()
```
- Solution log(min(n1,n2)) solution! Difficult to understand
```python
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:

- Problem Above-Average Subarrays
```
Above-Average Subarrays
You are given an array A containing N integers. Your task is to find all subarrays whose average sum is greater than the average sum of the remaining array elements. You must return the start and end index of each subarray in sorted order.
A subarray that starts at position L1 and ends at position R1 comes before a subarray that starts at L2 and ends at R2 if L1 < L2, or if L1 = L2 and R1 â‰¤ R2.
Note that we'll define the average sum of an empty array to be 0, and we'll define the indicies of the array (for the purpose of output) to be 1 through N. A subarray that contains a single element will have L1 = R1.
```
- Extra complicated solution that does not work using back tracking
- The problem with this solution is that we are not generating all possible subarrays we are finding contiguous subarrays.
```python
def aboveAverageSubarrays(A):
  # edge cases
  if len(A)==0:
    return []
  if len(A)==1:
    return A
  
  totalAvg = sum(A)/len(A) # Time Complexity O(n)
  output = []
  def findSubarray(subarray, subtotal, index):
    if index==len(A):
      subavg = subtotal/len(subarray)
      if subavg > totalAvg:
          firstIndex = subarray[0]+1
          lastIndex = subarray[-1]+1
          output.append([firstIndex, lastIndex])
      return # backtrack
    
    for i in range(index, A):
      subarray.append(i)
      subtotal+=A[i]
      findSubarray(subarray, subtotal, index+1)
      popI = subarray.pop()
      subtotal-=A[popI]
  
  findSubarray([],0,0)
  output = sorted(output, key=lambda arr: arr[0],arr[-1]) # sort by the last and first of the arr
  return output
```
- Actually working solution
- Cool things:
    - A subarray could be just 1 element
    - subarray_size can be calculated by doing `j-i+1`.
    - We can sort array of arrays by doing .sort in python!
```python
def aboveAverageSubarrays(A):
    n = len(A)
    total_sum = sum(A)
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over all possible subarrays
    for i in range(n):
        subarray_sum = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            # Compute the sum of the current subarray
            subarray_sum += A[j]
            subarray_size = j - i + 1
            # Compute the average of the subarray
            subarray_avg = subarray_sum / subarray_size
            
            # Remaining elements calculation
            remaining_size = n - subarray_size
            remaining_sum = total_sum - subarray_sum
            if remaining_size > 0:
                remaining_avg = remaining_sum / remaining_size
            else:
                remaining_avg = 0
            
            # Check if the subarray average is greater
            if subarray_avg > remaining_avg:
                result.append([i + 1, j + 1])  # Convert to 1-based indexing
    
    # Sort the results
    result.sort()
    return result

# Example usage
A = [3, 4, 2]
output = aboveAverageSubarrays(A)
print(output)

- [Problem Insert Into a Sorted Circular Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months)
- Solution
```python
    def insert(self, head: 'Optional[Node]', insertVal: int) -> 'Node':
        if head==None:
            # create a singular node and make it point to itself
            newNode = Node(insertVal)
            newNode.next = newNode
            return newNode
        curr = head

        while True:
            if curr.val<=insertVal<=curr.next.val:
                break
            
            # reached the last element
            if curr.val>curr.next.val:
                if curr.val<=insertVal>curr.next.val:
                    # insertVal is the greatest element
                    break
                
                if curr.next.val>=insertVal<curr.val:
                    # insertVal is the smallest element
                    break
            curr = curr.next

            # all elements are equal
            if curr == head:
                # reached the end
                break
        
        newNode = Node(insertVal)
        tmp = curr.next
        curr.next=newNode
        newNode.next = tmp
        return head
```
- the edge cases to test here are all the elements are equal, the target is the greatest element, the target is the smallest element, and the target is equal to the greatest element and the target is equal to the smallest element.
- The head won't always point to the smallest element but we know if we hit the head that all the elements in the array are equal.
- when we create a single node we have to make sure we point it back at itself.

        l_e1 = len(encoded1)
        l_e2 = len(encoded2)
        product_enc = []
        while e1<l_e1 and e2<l_e2:
            # print('encoded1[e1][0]',encoded1[e1][0])
            # print(' encoded2[e2][0]', encoded2[e2][0])
            min_freq = min(encoded1[e1][1], encoded2[e2][1])
            product = encoded1[e1][0] * encoded2[e2][0]
            # print('product',product)
            if not product_enc or product != product_enc[-1][0]:
                # new product or empty product_enc
                product_enc.append([product, min_freq])
                encoded1[e1][1]-=min_freq
                encoded2[e2][1]-=min_freq
            else:
                # same product
                product_enc[-1][1] += min_freq
                encoded1[e1][1]-=min_freq
                encoded2[e2][1]-=min_freq
            # e1 or e2 frequencies the same so we move the pointers
            if encoded1[e1][1]==0:
                e1 += 1
            if encoded2[e2][1]==0:
                e2 += 1

        return product_enc
        # O(e1+e2) space and time complexity
```
- Messed up with adding the frequency to the wrong place in the else statement and I did not subtract the min_freqs from the encoded array. (Also must make sure with interviewer that modifying the original data structure is okay)

- [Problem Friends of Appropriate Ages](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/description/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-six-months) TODO Come back to this problem
- Solution
```python
# constraint: 
    # n is len(ages) 1 <= n <= 2*10^4
    # 1<= ages[i] <=120
# brute force approach would be to use two for loops O(n^2)
# continue where the condition fails and do requests+=2 where ages are equal or 1 else where

# I think we can do better
# optimal time complexity: O(nlogn) sort the ages, binary search for each age.
# what would the binary search condition be?
# if one of these conditions is true person x will not send a friend request to person y.
    # age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
    # age[y] > age[x]
    # age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100

# first condition establishes a minimum age for y 
# second condition states y cannot be older than x
# third condition states that if y is older than 100 then x has to be older than x too.

    # is there a overlapping condition or summary conditon I can use

        return [output[col] for col in sorted(output.keys())]
```
- O(nlogn) Time Complexity from sorting
- O(n) Space Complexity with all the data structures we are using
- DO NOT MAKE INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS. I made the assumption that same row, col will be right next to each other which is wrong! I had no basis to make this assumption other than the patterns I saw in the input immediately and I thought it would continue. The solution I had previously was also more complex. Above is a good solution!
      - .sort() will sort lexicographically meaning it will break ties by comparing to the next value in the tuple. So that works out perfectly. We sort by col first, then row, so now we have earlier cols first and its associated earlies rows first, and finally comparing it by value if the rows and cols are equal.
