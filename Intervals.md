* When presented with an interval problem its important to clarify whether the intervals are open, closed, or half-open intervals. This can change the nature of the intervals overlapping.
* Two intervals overlap if they share at least 1 common value.
* It can be helpful to sort intervals so they can be processed. If you sort them by the start point it allows you to go through thek intervals in chronological order.
	* What happens if you sort the intervals by the end point?
