### My steps
1. Listen ... look for clues
  a. And get the requirements. Listen and look for clues. Interviewers do not try to give you clues that do not apply.
  b. If your answer does not use the details maybe its suboptimal
2. Write out examples.
  a. Look at larger examples?? Because it will make your brain do some work and that can point out the optimal algorithm. If its a simple example you can see the answer right away. Do not give special cases to the example. If its not sorted do not give a sorted example.
3. Give the brute force. Slow and obvious. Space and Time Complexity of it.
4. Optimize the algorithm
  a. You might spend a good bit of your time optimizing
  b. Some interviewers might ask you to write out the brute force which is okay as well.
5. Walk through algo. *Disclaimer*: Make sure you know exactly what you're doing before you code. It does not have to be correct
6. Write code. Expect to shoot for real correct code.
7. Verification Process
  a. Spend time looking for improvements: style, maintainability, etc.
  b. Show that you are a great coder who cares about writing quality code.

### For optimizing
- Look for bottlenecks, unnecessary work, and duplicated work.
- Optimizing with space and time.
  - What is the best conceivable runtime?
- Optimizing with DIY
  - Forget the computer stuff. Use a large and generic example and try to solve it intuitively
### Wait until you're ready to code.
- I understand the basic gist of what I'm going to write is not enough.
- Some candidates rush into code when they don't fully understand what they're going to do. This causes a lot of mistakes. Make sure you know exactly what the steps are.
- Interviewer might be like I see the basic idea, can i see the code, but do not start until you are ready!
- Wait until your interviewer is ready as well!
