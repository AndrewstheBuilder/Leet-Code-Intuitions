### [Problem Valid Palindrome III]()
```python
    def isValidPalindrome(self, s: str, k: int) -> bool:
        i = 0
        j = len(s)-1
        # memo = [[-1]*len(s)]*len(s) # this creates a shallow copy of each list
        memo = [[-1 for _ in range(len(s))] for _ in range(len(s))]
        def recurse(i,j):
            if i==j or i>j:
                return 0 # done processing string

            if memo[i][j] != -1:
                return memo[i][j]

            if s[i] != s[j]:
                # characters do not match
                # try both paths
                memo[i][j]=1+min(recurse(i+1,j), recurse(i,j-1))
                return memo[i][j]
            # characters match move on
            memo[i][j]=recurse(i+1, j-1)
            return memo[i][j]
        
        return recurse(i,j)<=k
```
- Time Complexity: O(n^2) we are going to find each pair of i,j when there is a character mismatch. O(n^2)
- Space Complexity: the function stack will be O(n), but the space complexity will be dominated by the memo data structure which is O(n^2)
