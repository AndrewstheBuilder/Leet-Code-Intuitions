1. [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-thirty-days)
```python
    def cloneGraph(self, node: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        if not node:
            return node

        visited = {}
        def visit(node):
            if node.val in visited:
                return visited[node.val]
            n = Node(node.val)
            visited[node.val] = n
            n.neighbors = [visit(ni) for ni in node.neighbors]
            return n
        return visit(node)
```
- The structure of the input was implied. We were given test cases that did not match the structure of the input.
- The intuition here is to visit each node as we are going and find its neighbors as we visit by recursively calling visit on its neighbors.
    - We manage the edge case of the node being null by returning node right away
    - Then at the end we return the node. Which works for the first call we do and all subsequent call on its neighbors. We are recursively going into its neighbors.
    - We have a to store a visited data structure becauses its a graph with no directions so to say that node a is connected to node b we do [a,b],[b,a] a bidirectional connection means it has no specified direction
- Time Complexity: O(n) we process each node once
- Space Complexity: O(n) we store the function in the call stack for the amount of nodes in the graph. We return immediately if the node has been visited.

2. [Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-thirty-days)
- Attempted solution. Did not work for all test cases notes below
```python

# Below attempted solution did not work but it was on the right track as the sliding window solution
# this took me a while to write. Possibly too much logic
# it was hard to explain everything while covering all scenarios so I have to simplify
    # I have to know the edge cases right away. I cannot think about it too long

            else:

                        total += 1
                left += 1
        return ''.join(shortest)
- Time Complexity: O(len(s))
- Space Complexity: O(len(s))
```
- Solution that works:
    - Keeping unique formed characters is genius.
    - the while shrinking loop is there without having a if statement. So is updating window_counts. It just makes for less lines of code. I do not think if I did have a extra check that it would affect logic
    - The order of updating then checking inside the dicts matters. r pointer gets updated at the end we process it at the beginning of the while loop to update window_counts and formed!
    - Its interesting they decided to shrink and contract in the same iteration. I guess we will not miss anything since we expand regardless of any logic and we shrink until the logic in while fails. If we shrunk then updated in next iteration it will bring back the same result.
``` python
 def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        l,r=0,0
        dict_t = Counter(t)
        required = len(dict_t) # length of unique characters in t 
        formed = 0 # number of freq matching unique t chars encountered in s
        window_counts = {} # keep freq of chars of t encountered in s
        ans = float('inf'),-1,-1 # window length, left pointer, right pointer
        while r<len(s):
            window_counts[s[r]] = window_counts.get(s[r], 0) + 1
            if(s[r] in dict_t and window_counts[s[r]]==dict_t[s[r]]):
                # freq of unique char matched between s and t
                formed += 1
            # shrink window to find smallest possible substring if formed == required
            while l<=r and formed==required:
                if(r-l+1<ans[0]):
                    ans = ((r-l+1),l,r)
                window_counts[s[l]] -= 1
                if s[l] in dict_t and window_counts[s[l]] < dict_t[s[l]]:
                    formed -= 1 # unique chars freq is not the same between s and t
                l += 1
            # keep expanding once we are done contracting
            r += 1
        return "" if ans[0]==float('inf') else s[ans[1]:ans[2]+1]
```
3. [Maximum Swap]()
- Solutions that do not work
```python
# missed the fact that I can swap two digits only once!
# this algorithm does not work!
def maxValueNum(num):
    if(num<10):
        return num
    n_arr = list(str(num))
    for i in range(len(n_arr)-1):
        for j in range(i+1, len(n_arr)):
            if(int(n_arr[j])>int(n_arr[i])):
                # swap
                temp = n_arr[i]
                n_arr[i] = n_arr[j]
                n_arr[j] = temp
    return ''.join(n_arr)

# 123 -> 321
# max_possible: (3,0)
# swapped = [0,2]

# this algorithm is using too much logic. I am probably headed in the wrong direction
def maxValueNum(num):
    if(num<10):
        return num
    n_arr = list(str(num))
    swapped=set()
    for i in range(len(n_arr)-1):
        max_possible = (-1,-1) # (n_arr[j], j)
        for j in range(i+1, len(n_arr)):
            if(int(n_arr[j])>int(n_arr[i]) and max_possible[0]<int(n_arr[j])):
                max_possible=(int(n_arr[j]),j)
        # swap
        if max_possible[1] not in swapped and i not in swapped:
            n_arr[max_possible[1]]=n_arr[i]
            n_arr[i] = str(max_possible[0])
            swapped.add(i)
            swapped.add(max_possible[1])
    return ''.join(n_arr)

# I am goin to stringify the integer to process it
# Go from right to left to get the largest num
# its apparent that the largest digit should be to the left
# so we will do a left to right traversal and see which large digit to the right can be moved to the left
# to store the largest digit I will use a list. It will do what exactly
# [123]
# maxRightIndex = [2,2,2]
def maxValueNum(self, num):
    num_str = str(num)
    n = len(num_str)
    max_right_index = [0]*n
    max_right_index[n-1] = n-1 # the last index no greater index to pull from
    for i in range(n - 
    2, -1, -1):
        # move the index of the max value from right to left
        max_right_index[i] = (
            i
            if num_str[i] > num_str[max_right_index[i + 1]]
            else max_right_index[i + 1]
        )
    # its confusing max_right_index will have indices that are duplicate
# TODO: the solution is incomplete here. But its right up to this part.
```
4. [Interval List Intersection](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/editorial/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-thirty-days)
- Attempted Solution
```python
def inter(firstList, secondList):
    if(len(firstList)==0 or len(secondList)==0):
        return []
    ret = []
    # how do I merge the two lists
    # if statement logic to see which lists have the smallest element for the start and which one has the largest element and then the second smallest and second largest will be the interval.
    # already see example where the above is not true
```
- Correct Solution
```python
    def maximumSwap(self, num: int) -> int:
        if(num<10):
            return num
        n_str = list(str(num))
        n = len(n_str)
        max_right_index = [0]*n
        max_right_index[n-1] = n-1
        for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
            max_right_index[i] = i if n_str[i]>n_str[max_right_index[i+1]] else max_right_index[i+1]
        
        for i in range(n):
            if(int(n_str[i])<int(n_str[max_right_index[i]])):
                # swap
                temp = n_str[max_right_index[i]]
                n_str[max_right_index[i]] = n_str[i]
                n_str[i] = temp
                return int(''.join(n_str)) # return after swapping with max index
        return num # return original num if no swap can be made
```
- I read the question wrong. Its saying you can " swap two digits at most once to get the maximum valued number". Meaning any two digits only once. Its not saying an indice can have only one swap.
    - That is why we return immediately after the maximum index to the right has been swapped with the first possible value on the left.

- [Problem Missing Ranges]()
- Solution
```python
   def findMissingRanges(self, nums: List[int], lower: int, upper: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(nums)
        if n==0:
            return [[lower,upper]]
        ret = []
        if lower<nums[0]:
            ret.append([lower,nums[0]-1])
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i+1]-nums[i]!=1:
                # add the range
                ret.append([nums[i]+1, nums[i+1]-1])
        if upper>nums[n-1]:
            ret.append([nums[n-1]+1, upper])

        return ret
```
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n) because of output
- I missed the the calculation will only ==1 and not -1 when there's no range between nums[i+1] and nums[i] because its in ascending order.

- [Problem Add Strings]()
- Solution
```python
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        carry = 0
        p1 = len(num1)-1
        p2 = len(num2)-1
        # 0 - 9 in ord
        # ord returns the unicode. unicode of 0 might be 48 and uncode of 1 49.
        # ord(1) - ord(0) = 1
        res = deque()
        while p1>=0 or p2>=0:
            n1 = ord(num1[p1])-ord('0') if p1>=0 else 0
            n2 = ord(num2[p2])-ord('0') if p2>=0 else 0
            ans = (n1+n2+carry)%10
            carry = (n1+n2+carry)//10
            res.appendleft(ans)
            p1 -= 1
            p2 -= 1
        if carry != 0:
            res.appendleft(carry)
        return ''.join(str(r) for r in res)
# Time Complexity: O(n1 + n2)
# Space Complexity: O(n1 + n2)
```
- I forgot that if I have a remainder I can just add it to 0 and continue on with the other number
- ord() returns the unicode of a number. So we are basically converting it to an int even though the instructions say to not do that.
- When i am calculating the ans or the carry i have to use parenthesis to evaluate that function first before doing the //10 or %10.
- Time complexity is O(n1+n2) with n1 being the length of num1 and n2 being the length of num2 respectively. We are processing n1 and maybe the remainder of n2 or vice versa. Or they could be equal
- Space complexity can have n1 and the rest of n2 or vice versa. And they could be equal

- [Problem Interval List Intersections]()
- Solution
```python
def inter(firstList, secondList):
    l1 = len(firstList)
    l2 = len(secondList)
    ans = []
    j = 0
    i = 0
    while i<l1 and j<l2:
        # the lo and the hi are the intersecting points
        lo = max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0])
        hi = min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1])
        if lo<=hi:
            ans.append([lo,hi])
        # move forward from the smallest interval endpoint
        if hi==firstList[i][1]:
            i+=1
        else:
            j+=1
    return ans
```
- Time Complexity: O(M+N)
- Space Complexity: O(M+N)
- we evaluate intersections on the lists until there are no more lists to evaluate. Seeing a visual of this makes it clearer
    - The interval is the max of the starts and the min of the ends of two comparisons. If lo>hi then the intervals never overlapped.
    - We move on from the interval with the lowest endpoint so that we can get to the next interval that might be included in the interval with the higher endpoint.
    - Don’t stop after getting an “Accepted”; spend a few more minutes thinking about some modifications for that given question. 

- [Problem Move Zeros]()
- Solution
```python
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        lastNonZeroIndex = 0
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i]!=0:
                nums[lastNonZeroIndex] = nums[i]
                lastNonZeroIndex += 1
        # last non zero index will end up the distance from n that shows the count of 0s in nums
        for i in range(lastNonZeroIndex, n):
            nums[i] = 0
        return
```
- Time Complexity: O(n) and Space Complexity: O(1)
- When you encounter a zero element do not update lastNonZeroIndex and move on to the next element. Last Non Zero Index will basically be pointing to that zero and every nonzero element will get moved to the left. At the end the space between where lastNonZeroIndex ends and where n is is the amount of zeros in nums. So we will fill that in with zeros in the last for loop.
      - The sub optimal solution to this is to store the non zero elements in a separate array and count the number of zeros. Then use a for loop to append zeros to the end of the new array by how many zeros were in nums.
- Follow up: Could I minimize the total number of operations done?
    - TODO write about it here!
- An edge case would be having zeros at the beginning of the array!

- [Problem Closest Binary Search Tree]()
- Solution
```python
   def closestValue(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], target: float) -> int:
        # compare to the left and right child and determine which one is closer
        if root == None:
            return None

        closest=float('inf')
        current = root
        while current:
            if abs(current.val - target) < abs(closest-target):
                closest = current.val
            elif abs(current.val - target) == abs(closest-target):
                closest = current.val if current.val < closest else closest
                
            if current.val>target:
                current = current.left
            else:
                current = current.right
        
        return closest
```
- O(logn) time complexity its cutting the search space in half every time. Derivation: (n/2^k = 1) n =2^k -> log(n) = k
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- I missed the fact that if the distances between target, closest and current node are the same. Then we set the closest variable to the lowest valued node.

- [Problem Exclusive Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/?envType=company&envId=facebook&favoriteSlug=facebook-thirty-days&role=full-stack)
- Solution
```python
   def exclusiveTime(self, n: int, logs: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        ans = [0]*n
        stack = [] # stack to keep track of currently running functions
        prev_time = 0 # the last timestamp processes

        for log in logs:
            # parse the log
            res = log.split(":")
            func_id, word, time = int(res[0]),res[1],int(res[2])

            if word=='start':
                if stack:
                    ans[stack[-1]] += time-prev_time # current_time - last time we had is the total time ran so far for last started function
                stack.append(func_id)
                prev_time = time # we are including the start time for the next time we encounter
            else:
                current_func = stack.pop()
                ans[current_func] += time-prev_time+1 # +1 to include the unit of time we started at.
                prev_time = time+1 # move to next unit of time because we processed for +1 from end time. Example if end_time=6 we processed from 6-7 time.
        return ans
```
- its a single threaded cpu. Pay attention to where I converted the string to int for the func_id and time. I also kept track of prev_time. At the start we include the prev_time as the current time since we will be processing from there. At the end we process from time to time+1. so we update prev_time to where time stopped which is time+1. This is also why we add +1 to ans on the "end" of the function.
    - It was a good idea to keep the stack of functions for what function is running currently. Its last in first out.

- Time Complexity: O(logn) we are halving the search space each time.
- Space Complexity: O(1) the storage does not grow proportionally to the input.
- Once I find the target I have to search backwards and forwards from the found spot to make sure I have start and end correctly.
- I forgot that to calculate the mid we need to do the (hi-lo)//2 method and then add it to lo because its the midway point between hi and low and not 0 and len(nums)-1. We also do lo<=hi for the while loop to include the point where lo==hi!

- [Problem Multiply Strings]()
- Solution with right intuitions. Probably should not do anything like this in a interview because its complex and buggy.
```python
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        ans = deque()
        n1 = len(num1)
        n2 = len(num2)
        l = n1 if n1>n2 else n2
        remainder = 0
        for i in range(l):
            e1 = e2 = None
            if n2>i:
                e1 = ord(num1[i]) - ord('0')
            if n1>i:

- Intuition for using ord and doing ord('0') to indirectly convert string to integer. And to do the multiplication like we would do it long form on with paper with a remainder is spot on intuition. My implementation just sucked. I could not figure out how to make it work with parsing the string and how to account for different lengths of num1 and num2 while multiplying. My solution is cumbersome
    - I also think I could benefit from reversing the strings of num1 and num2 maybe that will make the solution easier and more elegant.
- Solution
```python
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        # If any number is zero, the product is zero
        if num1 == "0" or num2 == "0":
            return "0"
            
        # Result can be at most len(num1) + len(num2) digits
        result = [0] * (len(num1) + len(num2))
        
        # Multiply each digit from right to left
        for i in range(len(num1)-1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(len(num2)-1, -1, -1):
                # Multiply single digits
                prod = (ord(num1[i]) - ord('0')) * (ord(num2[j]) - ord('0'))
                # Sum with existing value at the correct position
                sum_ = prod + result[i + j + 1]
                # Set digit and carry
                result[i + j + 1] = sum_ % 10
                result[i + j] += sum_ // 10

        # Convert to string, skipping leading zeros
        start = 0
        while start < len(result)-1 and result[start] == 0:
            start += 1
        return ''.join(map(str, result[start:]))
```
- This is the answer but I have to come back to this. I am not sure how they decided to do result[i+j+1].
      - result can be at most len(num1)+len(num2) though because of this proof. A digit of length m can be at most 10^m while being less than 10^m and at least 10^(m-1). So that gives the upper bound 10^m. so the maximum length of two numbers with lengths m and n will be num1*num2 or 10^m * 10^n => 10^(m+n) which gives the upper bound of the length of digits being m+n.
- OMG I got it. Say you have a 3 len num1 and 3 len num2. That is a total of 6 len. But since we are 0 indexed we are going to be doing for the first iteration 2+2=4 and we have to add 1 to it to be 5 which is the last spot in the array of length 6!
    - This is basically doing and storing the result like we are doing the math by hand.
- 0 indexed means we are off by 1 when compared to the actual length of the array the last spot is 1 less than the length. So if we add the last spot index of 1 array plus the last spot index of the other array to get the last spot index of an array that is the length of the firstArray + secondArray it would only be off by 1!!! and not 2!!! Weird right! That is because getting to index 2 in a array actually involved 3 spaces but adding 2 to that index means an actual 2 more spaces. So you can think of the first index in the addition as the accessing of location 2 then we add two more indices to get to the 4th location which is only 2 away from index 2, but index 2 is 3 away from the start which is index 0.

        # instead of the for loop we will store the areas we visit and save it so we do not have to compute the area again
        # the area possible from each index will be stored
        # then we will go through the grid, find a 0 to change to 1 and find its four possible neighbors and calculate the max possible area from the
